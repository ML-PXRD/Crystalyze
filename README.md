# Crystalyze Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for the Crystalyze project. This code is built on top of the excellent [Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder](https://github.com/txie-93/cdvae) repository and uses the XRD CNN model architecture from the [UnifiedML XRD repository](https://github.com/AGI-init/XRDs/tree/main)

## Overview

Crystalyze is a machine learning model that combines XRD representation learning with a crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (CDVAE) to generate crytal structures given an x-ray diffraction pattern.
