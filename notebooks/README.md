# Notebooks for Crystalyze

1. Proper data pipeline: proper_data_pipeline.ipynb. This is the series of steps that were used to create the mp_20 simulated data. 
2. Proper data pipeline augmented: proper_data_pipeline_augmented.ipynb. This is the series of steps that were used to create the mp_20 augmented simulated data.
3. Inference: inference.ipynb. This is a standalone notebook that one can use to get generated crystal structures from a small number of diffraction patterns with minimal overhead. Note that without struct snap, lattice paramters will likely have high variance. 
4. Computing metrics: compute_metrics.ipynb. This notebook generates the raw result data for the metrics used in the paper. Summary statistics can be easily derived from the output matrices. 

NOTE: All notebooks are preliminary and may note transfer seemlessly to other environments. If you encounter any issues please feel free to reach out or open an issue!
